# Driver-Drowsiness-detection---Python
Our drowsiness detection system uses OpenCV, an open-source computer vision
library, to track the driver's eyes and detect signs of drowsiness. The system operates in
real-time and continuously monitors the driver's eyes for signs of fatigue or drowsiness implemented in Python.
